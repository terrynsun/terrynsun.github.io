As part of the Lil AVCX 2025 roster, I wrote a series of six midi (~10x10)
puzzles, with much help and editing by the incredible Will Eisenberg:

* ["Chosen Family"](https://avxwords.com/puzzles/1883/) (8/25/25)
* ["A Trip to the Zoo"](https://avxwords.com/puzzles/1861/) (7/14/25)
* ["Taste the Rainbow"](https://avxwords.com/puzzles/1839/) (6/9/25)
* ["Perfect Cubes"](https://avxwords.com/puzzles/1818/) (5/5/25)

Two more are upcoming!

AVCX is an online, indie crossword publication that does incredible work â€” I
encourage you to support them, but I am also able to share copies of my work.
Just ask!

Other work:
