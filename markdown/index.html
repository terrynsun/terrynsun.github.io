  <p class="header">about me</p>

  <p>I am in my third year studying Computer Science at the University of
  Pennsylvania. I've been a part of the
  <a href="http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/">Science & Technology Wing</a>
  Residential Program for all three years and have been Communications Manager
  at KCECH for the last two.</p>

  <p>I've been very interested in security for the past several semesters. I've
  following
  <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>
  for several months and am now delving into PL.</p> 

  <p>I play video games on the off-time from school, recently including
  Awesomenauts, Transistor, ibb & obb. A lifetime ago I fancied myself to be a
  writer.</p>

  <p>I run with Arch Linux, i3, and vim.

  <p class="header">things I do</p>

  <p>I've been a CIS240 (Intro to Computer Architecture & C) teaching assistant
  twice over (S'14, F'14), and remain involved in the class to oversee the beta
  release of Elsie (S'15). This semester I'll be a TA for
  <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis331">CIS331</a> (Networks & Security).
  </p>

  <p>I'm working with
  <a href="https://twitter.com/topherthegeek">@topherthegeek</a>
  and some other students this semester on contributing to
  <a href="http://treode.github.io">TreodeDB</a>
  as part of the Facebook Open Source Academy.</p>

  <p>I spent the last summer hanging out in Sunnyvale with
  <a href="http://matasano.com">Matasano Security</a>
  doing the Internet of Things research project with a cool group of
  interns. Next summer I'll be at
  <a href="https://squareup.com">Square</a>!</p>
