# about me

Computer Science @ University of Pennsylvania > Cloudflare > OneSignal

At Penn, I lived on the [Science & Technology Wing] [STWing] for 3 years.

I also co-created and taught a class, [CIS198], which is a half-credit on the
Rust programming language. All course materials are [available online][CIS198]!

I play video games, mostly indie games and couch co-op.
I cook and bake. I run and I just bought a new bike.
I read, and I'm always looking for book recommendations.

I run with Arch Linux, i3, and vim. ([Dotfiles].)
