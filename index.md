<div class="large-3 medium-3 columns"> <p class="header">about me</p>

I am in my fifth year studying Computer Science at the University of
Pennsylvania. I've been a part of the
[Science & Technology Wing] [STWing]
Residential Program for all four years and have been Communications Manager
at KCECH for two.

I play video games on the (rare) off-time from school, recently including
Hyper Light Drifter, Kentucky Route Zero, and Zelda: Four Swords Adventure. A lifetime ago I
fancied myself to be a writer. I like to cook.

I run with Arch Linux, i3, and vim. ([Dotfiles][dotfiles-bb].)

<p class="proj"><a href="https://github.com/terrynsun/WebGL-Fragment-Shader-Profiler">
WebGL Fragment Shader Profiler</a></p>

A Chrome extension for profiling fragment shaders. This runs on a webpage,
accesses the GLSL programs running on it, and profile the fragment shader(s) over
different pixels. Uses (beta) WebGL Disjoint Timer Query, available on
pre-release versions of Chrome.

<p class="proj"><a href="https://github.com/rustoscript/js.rs">js.rs</a></p>

An interpreter for JavaScript written in Rust.

<p class="proj"><a href="http://elsie4.bitbucket.org">Elsie</a></p>

An LC4 assembler & simulator, currently released in beta for CIS240. Supports
live-updating full memory table and graphical map, and memory-mapped IO
registers for console (input/output) and video output.

<p class="proj"> <a href="https://github.com/terrynsun/CIS565-P3-CUDA-Path-Tracer">GPU Pathtracer</p>

Global illumination renderer with work-efficient stream compaction; antialiasing; subsurface scattering; refraction, diffuse, specular surfaces

<p class="note">(CIS565 class project.)</p>

<p class="proj">PortholesOS</p>
<p>A GuestOS, which spawns threads as child processes, capable of running a
basic shell (kernel signals, job control), and persistent filesystem.</p>

This semester, I'm co-teaching and developing [CIS198](cis198-2016s.github.io), a brand new mini-course on
Rust! Open course materials available on GitHub. I'm also TAing
[CIS331](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis331/) for the second time.

<!--
This is my third time as a CIS240 (Intro to Computer Architecture & C) teaching assistant
(Fall 14, Spring 14, Fall 15). I work on an LC4 simulator replacement for the
class called <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis240/elsie">Elsie</a>. In Spring 15, I TA'd for
<a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis331">CIS331</a> (Networks & Security).

Last summer I had the pleasure of staying in San Francisco and working at Square.
The summer before, I worked on the [Internet of Things Whitepaper][iot-things-paper]
with Matasano Security (now NCC Group).
