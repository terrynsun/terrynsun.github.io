<div class="large-3 medium-3 columns"> <p class="header">about me</p>

I am in my fourth year studying Computer Science at the University of
Pennsylvania. I've been a part of the
[Science & Technology Wing] [STWing]
Residential Program for all four years and have been Communications Manager
at KCECH for two.

I play video games on the (rare) off-time from school, recently including
Awesomenauts, Transistor, ibb & obb. A lifetime ago I fancied myself to be a
writer.

I run with Arch Linux, i3, and vim. ([Dotfiles][dotfiles-bb].)

This is my third time as a CIS240 (Intro to Computer Architecture & C) teaching assistant
(Fall 14, Spring 14, Fall 15). I work on an LC4 simulator replacement for the
class called <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis240/elsie">Elsie</a>. In Spring 15, I TA'd for
<a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis331">CIS331</a> (Networks & Security).

Last summer I had the pleasure of staying in San Francisco and working at Square.
The summer before, I worked on the [Internet of Things Whitepaper][iot-things-paper]
with Matasano Security (now NCC Group).
