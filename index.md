# about me

I recently graduated with Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Computer Science
from the University of Pennsylvania. Now I work at Cloudflare.

I was part of the [Science & Technology Wing] [STWing].

[stwing]: http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/

I co-created and taught a class, [CIS198], which is a half-credit on the
Rust programming language. All course materials are [available online][CIS198]!

[CIS198]: http://cis198-2016f.github.io

I play video games, mostly indie games and (preferably couch) co-op games. I
cook a lot and bake, mostly bread. I read, mostly scifi and books about food.

I run with Arch Linux, i3, and vim. ([Dotfiles].)
