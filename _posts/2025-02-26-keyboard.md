I love my keyboard! It's a split mechanical keyboard built from the
[Keeb.io Viterbi] (rev2) kit. It's 5x7 on each half; I like having a lot of keys. I
have a full number row (doubling as function keys) and arrow keys (doubling as
media keys).

It has a custom layout built with [QMK]. This page is primarily docs for my own
reference.

My layout configuration is [here](https://github.com/terrynsun/qmk_firmware/blob/main/keyboards/keebio/viterbi/keymaps/terrynsun/keymap.c). Fun stuff that I have:

- Media controls
- A mouse click key
- En- and em-dashes
- A numpad

## Flashing

For reasons I don't really remember, but probably involve saving $10, I got one
[Pro Micro] (Arduino-compatible ATmega32U4) and one [Elite-C V4] instead of two
Elite-Cs. Which unfortunately means that flashing the two halves of my keyboard
takes separate commands.

[Pro Micro]: https://keeb.io/products/elite-c-low-profile-version-usb-c-pro-micro-replacement-atmega32u4?srsltid=AfmBOooHh8iyq0xFgj3OpkeBYvTwQRrqjDHiHHYmJighU2emwuTmzg2n
[Elite-C V4]: https://keeb.io/products/pro-micro-5v-16mhz-arduino-compatible-atmega32u4?srsltid=AfmBOorkkWUtfPKZa5EZvnxvwnDEcorXS6eLrDISSuRI87WJhkW2IufC

To flash the left (primary) half, which owns the Elite-C:

```
make keebio/viterbi/rev2:terrynsun:dfu
# or
qmk flash -bl dfu
```

For the right half:

```
make keebio/viterbi/rev2:terrynsun:avrdude
# or
qmk flash -bl avrdude
```

## QMK setup

```
yay qmk
qmk setup terrynsun/qmk_firmware -b main -H ~/src/qmk_firmware
qmk config user.keyboard=keebio/viterbi/rev2
qmk config user.keymap=terrynsun
```

These config commands create this file at `~/.config/qmk/qmk.ini`:

```ini
[user]
keyboard = keebio/viterbi/rev2
keymap = terrynsun
```

## Switches

Most of my switches are Gateron Silent Browns. A few modifier keys (enter,
special, click) have Outemu Silent Sky Switches. My left enter is a 
Zilent V2 (Silent Tactile).
