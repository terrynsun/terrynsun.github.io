# Boot disk

1. Download ubuntu iso: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
2. dd if=iso of=/dev/--- bs=4M

# XPS 9300

1. Disable Intell RST in the bios. Ubuntu sent me to help.ubuntu.com/rst, which wasn't that
   helpful. Boot into bios, then set SATA controller to AHCI. (Make.. sure that
   that the SSD is still enabled after you do so.)
2. Boot into laptop. Press F12 while booting for boot menu. Follow the prompts.
   It's easy!

(I didn't have to do this on my newer computer, for some reason.)

# Update system

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt autoremove
```

# Dotfiles

```
sudo apt install i3 git zsh tmux polybar
git clone https://github.com/terrynsun/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./init.sh

chsh # /usr/bin/zsh
```

Log out, log into i3.

# i3-mate

```
sudo apt install ubuntu-mate-desktop
gsettings set com.solus-project.brisk-menu hot-key ''
gsettings set org.mate.session.required-components windowmanager i3
gsettings set org.mate.session.required-components filemanager ''

gsettings set org.mate.session.required-components panel ''
```
