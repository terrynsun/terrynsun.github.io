0. HTML (2015)

I wrote the first draft of this one-page website in HTML directly. I think
there's still something satisfying about the simplicity of about writing HTML
and CSS into files and having them render.

1. Jekyll / Foundation 5 (2015)

Converting to Jekyll was my third commit, and I imported Foundation at the same
time.

2. Foundation 6 (2019)

A short detour. I updated my website to Foundation 6, but never actually changed
any of the text on the website. This was my first time using a CSS Grid-style
layout, rather than the 12-column style of original Bootstrap and Foundation.
Kinda neat.

3. Bare CSS (2020)

I have a problem with CSS. It's the same problem every time. I'm impatient. I
skim a few pages on what I'm trying to do, skip the nitty-gritty explanation that explains what I was trying to do, then guess-and-check the various related directives
until something works. And when nothing looks quite right, I finally give up and
_actually_ read the guide from the beginning:

* https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/an-introduction-to-css-grid-layout-part-1/
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox

I almost used Skeleton/Barebones, but I realized I could build my own responsive
layout with flexbox.
