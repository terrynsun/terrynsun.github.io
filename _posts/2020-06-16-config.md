title: Config changes after 3 years of work
layout: post
---

Most of my linux configuration I still use today was set in college. My first
three years of work led to relatively few configuration changes. Here they are:

# vimrc

Now necessary when sharing repos with people who don't have trailing newlines
configured. I spent probably about a year and a half using `git add -p` to
manually exclude trailing newline changes before I figured out this might be
configurable.

```
set nofixendofline " stop adding trailing newlines
```

# zshrc

I haven't started using fish shell yet, but I did enable syntax highlighting.

```
plugins=(z sudo zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

And, now that I worked on feature/PR branches, I wanted something to display my
git branch in my terminal.

```
# Print git branch in right prompt
setopt PROMPT_SUBST
rprompt() {
  br=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || true)
  echo -n "%F{green}%~%f"
  [ -n "$br" ] && echo -n " %F{blue}$br%f"
}
export RPROMPT='$(rprompt)'
```

# Other

I started using `rg` instead of `grep`. I'm still using vim (no VS Code yet).
